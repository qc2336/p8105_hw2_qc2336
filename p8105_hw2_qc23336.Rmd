```

##Problem 1
```{r cars}
pol_month = read_csv(file = "./data/pols-month.csv")

pol_month
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
